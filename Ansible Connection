create user
give them root access
create ssh-keygen
go to "sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config" and change the "Password Authentication" to yes
then restart the sshd "sudo service sshd restart"

now you can copy your key to the slave servers by ssh-copy-id username@private-ip-address
if successful then login to the slave node from your remote node by ssh username@private-ip-address
